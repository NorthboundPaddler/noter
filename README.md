# Noter

## Usage
*Note*: I haven't figured out how to get the commands to show up 'normally' so they can be used as such: `:exec <function>()`. For example, the following would call the TestNoter function from noter.py: `:exec TestNoter()`

## Quickstart
First, you need to initialize a database.

```:exec NoterBuildDB```

## Troubleshooting
To get the most recent plugin updates, you can `:PackerUpdate` and then `:UpdateRemotePlugins`. This should give you access to new commands, otherwise it might be necessary to restart Neovim.
